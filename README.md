# Resources for Contextual Stochastic Optimization

[Conferences and Workshops](conferences.md)

## Description
Links to CSO resources for research on data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on methods that adapt decisions to real-time contextual information.  The goal is to provide an accessible entry point and living reference for CSO, helping newcomers and experts alike navigate core concepts, related disciplines, and real-world use cases.

The vision of CSO is to move beyond static policies toward **adaptive** decision rules, blending ideas from stochastic optimization, online learning, machine learning, and generative models. CSO connects technical communities in Operations Research, Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Reinforcement Learning, and Causal Inference, as well as practice communities in data science, and analytics.

This repository organizes links to materials such as lecture notes, tutorials, key papers, benchmark problem descriptions, and example implementations. It emphasizes themes including risk-aware and robust optimization, contextual bandits and learning-augmented algorithms, interpretable decision rules, and scalable large-scale solvers, as well as applications spanning: supply chains and logistics, healthcare operations, energy and grid management, pricing and revenue management, portfolio and risk management, and public-sector planning.
